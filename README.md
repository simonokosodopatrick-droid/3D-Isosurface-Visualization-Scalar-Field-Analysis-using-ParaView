This project demonstrates the use of ParaView for processing and visualizing 3D scientific datasets. Using a synthetic wavelet scalar field, I implemented a visualization pipeline to identify and extract specific data structures.

Key Technical Features:

Data Generation: Utilized the Wavelet source to simulate a 3D sampled dataset.

Contour Extraction: Applied the Contour filter to generate an isosurface, allowing for the visualization of constant values within the scalar field.

Color Mapping: Implemented a diverging color map (RTData) to clearly represent data gradients and intensity variations across the 3D model.

State Management: Included a .pvsm (ParaView State) file to ensure the entire visualization pipeline is reproducible and can be audited.

Files in this Repository:

visualization.png: High-resolution render of the final 3D contour.

project.pvsm: Complete ParaView state file for workflow reconstruction.
